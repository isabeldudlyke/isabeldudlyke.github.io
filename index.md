# Hi, I'm Michael.

## I am an undergraduate and Pratt Fellow at Duke University.

Right now, my work focuses on harnessing deep learning to solve big problems. I am a researcher in both the
<a href="https://singhlab.net">Singh Lab</a> and the <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/lab.html">Interpretable Machine Learning Lab</a>.
Beyond research, I am passionate about music, entrepreneurship, and photography.
